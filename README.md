# Covid-19 Country Analysis

## Project Overview
* A comprehensive data analysis project examining global COVID-19 pandemic statistics across 187 countries. This project demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization skills using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn.
  
## Key Features & Analysis
ðŸ“Š Data Processing & Quality
* Imported and cleaned COVID-19 dataset with 187 countries and 15 metrics
* Handled data quality issues and missing values
* Created calculated fields (death rate, recovery rate, active cases)
  
ðŸ“ˆ Statistical Analysis
* Global pandemic statistics (16.4M confirmed cases, 654K deaths, 9.4M recovered)
* Calculated global death rate (3.97%) and recovery rate (57.47%)
* Identified countries with highest confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery rates
* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report (country_wise_latest.csv)

ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights
* Top 10 Countries Analysis: Identified countries with highest death rates, recovery rates, and active cases
* Growth Analysis: Examined weekly growth patterns and trends
* Regional Patterns: Analyzed COVID-19 impact across different WHO regions

ðŸ“Š Data Visualizations
